# PoliceAnimations

Adds a kneel surrender animation to FiveM.

## Installation

Copy the `RPAnimations` folder into your FXServer's resources folder, and add `start RPAnimations` to the bottom of your server.cfg.

## Use

Type `/k` or `/kneel` in chat to surrender into your knees.

Type `/r` or `/radio` in chat to talk on the radio

Type `/l`, `/lie` or `/liedown` in chat to lie motionless on the floor

Type `/c` or `/cpr` in chat to complete a rescue breath and begin chest compressions. You can use it again to immediately stop CPR, or you can use `/cfail` or `/csuccess` to end in a nicer animation.
